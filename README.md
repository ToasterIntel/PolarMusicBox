# Polar Music Box
The best analogy I can think of for this project is as follows:

Imagine you have a special clock. Instead of a minute and hour hand, this clock has a metal comb (just like the sort found in a music box or on a kalimba).
As time goes on, this special comb-hand rotates around the center of the clock like a normal time-telling hand. 
Now imagine you place small pins on the clock face, such that any given pin will strike one of the teeth of the comb-hand as it travels around the clock.
Depending on how far from the center and how far around the clock we place the pins, we can control the timing and pitch of the tones our clock-instument produces.
If you're familiar with mathematics, you might see some parallels between our pin placement and a polar coordinate system and realize that if we treat our pins as points within some polar space, we can mathematically define new melodies.

To continue exploring this idea, let's call the distance from the center of our clock to our pin *r*. We'll express how far around the clock the pin is by calling it's angle past 3 o'clock in the counterclockwise direction *theta*.
Now we can think about our pin placement as a set of polar coordinates (*r*, *theta*). By defining our pin placement with some mathematical funtion and then running the clock-insturment, we can actually hear our functions.
